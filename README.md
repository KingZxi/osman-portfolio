# Final to-do list:

These are some of the final changes I plan to make before submission:

## Requirements:

- You need three extra pages, though they should be simple to implement after finishing design
  - About Me
  - SCS Coaliton
  - Coding Projects (This can be empty with a 'coming soon' text for the time being)

## Suggestions from peers:

- You should put your Netmatters project in the projects section
- Make your social icons link to the correct places, they currently link nowhere
- Social icons hide? 767-1599px (After changing the sidebar min-width in general, this seems to no longer be a problem)
- The OM image should link back to the top of the page / index page
- Header / banner text can collide margins with sidebar and text if small enough: 768-1180px
- Landscape needs some work (Seems better now, done)
- You can set the sidebar link widths to 100% and there display to block, so the empty space around them is also clickable.

## Personal goals:

- Refactor code, things right now are quite messy.
