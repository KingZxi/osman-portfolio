This all refers to an earlier version of the project before JS was intended to be implemented:

# Final to-do list:

These are some of the final changes I plan to make before submission:

## Requirements:

- You need three extra pages, though they should be simple to implement after finishing design
  - About Me
  - SCS Coaliton
  - Coding Projects (This can be empty with a 'coming soon' text for the time being)

## Suggestions from peers:

- You should put your Netmatters project in the projects section (Done)
- Make your social icons link to the correct places, they currently link nowhere (Done)
- Social icons hide? 767-1599px (After changing the sidebar min-width in general, this seems to no longer be a problem)
- The OM image should link back to the top of the page / index page (Done)
- Header / banner text can collide margins with sidebar and text if small enough: 768-1180px (This still occurs, but it's not a site-breaking issue so as of right now, I'm going to leave it as it allows the text to center correctly with no clear issues.)
- Landscape needs some work (Seems better now, done)
- You can set the sidebar link widths to 100% and there display to block, so the empty space around them is also clickable. (I tried implementing this but it didn't go as planned, it's probably simple enough to do so I'll get back to it after other changes)

## Personal goals:

- Refactor code, things right now are quite messy. (Code is a bit nicer now, done) -->
